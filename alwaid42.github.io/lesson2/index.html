        Solar energy
      </h4>
      <p>
        Solar energy is widely avaiable and has many uses.
        One use for example is in archetcture where people plan windows in ways they can use sunlight to light a room. Or when we leave something in the sun to dry it.
        Another way to use this energy is to build a capting system to store the solar energy and reuse it later.
        One of the main systems to utilize this solar energy is the Photovoltaic Solar System.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Photovoltaic Solar Energy
      </h4>
      <p>
        This system consist of photovoltaic cells that are able to transform solar radiation into electrical energy through an effect called "Photovoltaic effect". This cells are usually installed in modules or solar pannels. Then the energy generated by the pannels can be used or stored in batteries.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <h4>
        What is the price for installing a photovoltaic system
      </h4>
      <p>
        The price relies on a series of factor as the daily energy consume, the size of the place where the system will be installed, the level of sun radiation in the region and others.
        
        You can contact us for an estimate price to attend your needs.
        Usually this is an investment that pays itself in the period of 3 to 5 years.
      </p>
      <h4>
        How long does a photovoltaic system lasts?
      </h4>
      <p>
        This is one of the biggest questions about solar systems. 
        It depends on the quality of the equipment and having maintenance in the equipments.
        Usually it lasts for 25 years, and it can last for longer periods even up to 50 years, but over time its efficience has a decay.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Does a solar system work when it is clouded? Or at night?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The solar systems keeps producing energy during clouded days, the production can be lower but it keeps working. During the night the system doesn't produce energy
